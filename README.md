# SPG 2

SPG 2 is the direct sequel to Stellar Pong Game, that was my first ever made game
This sequel will also run on C++ and with the Raylib 5.0 library

## The objective

Beat this game and get all of the achievements. Yes, you heard it, achievements ! Last time, i haven't done, but trust me, you're gonna love this

## To be able to play this game, you need:
- RayLib 5.0 (in the C:/ disk) ; ( https://www.raylib.com )
- Visual Studio Code (to change the code or see what it looks like) with the C/C++ extension ;
( https://code.visualstudio.com )
- MinGW as the compiler (v6.3.0 or later, and in the C:/ disk) ; ( https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MinGW/Base/gcc/Version6/gcc-6.3.0/ )

The configuration to make Raylib 5.0 work with VS Code is already done in the folder, so you don't need to do it youself.
